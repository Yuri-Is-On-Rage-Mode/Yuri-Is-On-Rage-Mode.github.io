can you make a sliding card animation with top ten posts in "./JsonD/LatestReleases.json":
with example data of: "{
    "122": {
        "date": "1-june-2024",
        "text": "We are launching a new product",
        "link": "/NewProduct/Demo1.html"
    },
    "123": {
        "date": "8-july-2024",
        "text": "Website Updated",
        "link": "/NewProduct/Demo2.html"
    }
}
"
can you make it to show last ten posts which will be randing from the higest number of posts to -10: in a <div> in cards froms
